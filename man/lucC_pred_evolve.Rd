\arguments{
\item{raster_obj}{Raster. A raster stack with classified images}

\item{raster_class1}{Character. Name of the first class present in a row of the tibble, such as 'Forest' or other value}

\item{time_interval1}{Interval. A interval of time to verify if class is over or
not in character format. Given a tibble with values, will be asserts if that
class of locations holds during a time interval}

\item{raster_class2}{Character. Name of the second class present in a row of the tibble, such as 'Forest' or other value}

\item{time_interval2}{Interval. A interval of time to verify if class is over or
not in character format. Given a tibble with values, will be asserts if that
class of locations holds during a time interval}

\item{label}{Character. All labels of each value of pixel of classified raster}

\item{timeline}{Date. A list with all end_dates of classified raster}
}
\value{
Tibble with all events hold during a time interval
}
\description{
Provide a predicate of Allen's which asserts that a class holds
during a time interval. Return a tibble with value within defined interval
