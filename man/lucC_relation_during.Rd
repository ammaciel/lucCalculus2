\description{
Provide an Allen's interval relation DURING which start time interval of the
raster_1 must be (>) greater than the start time interval from raster_2, and end time interval
of the raster_1 must be (<) less than the end time interval from raster_2. See more at (ALLEN, J. F.
"Maintaining knowledge about temporal intervals". Communications of the ACM, v(26), 11,
1983, 832-843. DOI: \url{http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/182.358434})
