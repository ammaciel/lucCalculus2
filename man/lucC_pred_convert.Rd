\usage{
lucC_pred_convert (raster_obj = NULL, raster_class1 = NULL,
time_interval1 = c("2001-01-01", "2001-01-01"), relation_interval1 = "equals",

relation_interval2 = "equals", label = NULL, timeline = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{raster_obj}{Raster. A raster stack with classified images}

\item{raster_class1}{Character. Name of the first class of interest, such as 'Forest', to research}

\item{time_interval1}{Interval. A first interval to verify if class is over or not}

\item{relation_interval1}{Character. If a location HOLDS during all time interval 'equals' or can be appear in any
times 'contains'. Default is 'equals'}

\item{raster_class2}{Character. Name of the second class of interest, such as 'Pasture', to research}

\item{time_interval2}{Interval. A second interval to verify if class is over or not}

\item{relation_interval2}{Character. If a location HOLDS during all time interval 'equals' or can be appear in any
times 'contains'. Default is 'equals'}

\item{label}{Character Vector. All labels of each value of pixel from classified raster}

\item{timeline}{Character. A list of all dates of classified raster, timeline}
}
\value{
Matrix with all states which holds during a time interval
}
\description{
Provide a predicate CONVERT which evaluates as true when a location holds the
class \code{c_i}, e.g. 'Forest', during the interval \code{t_i}, class \code{c_j}, e.g. 'Soybean',
during the interval \code{t_j} and \code{t_j} is sequential of \code{t_i}. Return a matrix
with values within defined interval
}
